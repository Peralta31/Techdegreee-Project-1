        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Since I was a little kid I've always been interested in computers, and fascinated by their capabilities. I've always knew I wanted a career that had to do with computers, but I was never sure which specific field I wanted to have a career in. Untill a friend introduced me to code, and showed me the endless possiblities that one can do. That is when I knew I wanted to have a career in coding.</p>
        <p>Working as a Reccreation Aide and Ticket Seller for six years, at Naval Medical Center San Diego and Naval Base San Diego. Has thought me many skills, and also life experiences, that can help me out when I become a web developer.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include Boxing, Muay Thai, Gaming, and Making Eelctronic Music.</p>
